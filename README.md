Data transformations refer to the process of modifying the original data in various ways to prepare it for modeling and analysis. In the context of the project described in the document, the data transformations that may have been applied could include:

1. *Scaling and Normalization*:
   - Scaling the features to a common range (e.g., 0-1 or -1 to 1) to ensure that all features have a similar magnitude and impact on the model.
   - Normalizing the features using techniques like mean normalization or standardization to remove the effects of different measurement scales.

2. *Handling Missing Values*:
   - Imputing missing values using techniques like mean/median imputation, k-nearest neighbors, or more advanced methods like matrix factorization or time series-specific imputation.
   - Flagging or encoding the missing values in a way that can be used by the model.

3. *Handling Outliers*:
   - Identifying and handling outliers in the data, either by removing them, capping them, or using robust regression techniques that are less sensitive to outliers.
   - Applying techniques like Winsorization, Robust Scaler, or Isolation Forest to detect and handle outliers.

4. *Feature Transformations*:
   - Applying non-linear transformations to the features, such as logarithmic, exponential, or polynomial transformations, to capture non-linear relationships.
   - Creating interaction terms between features to account for potential synergistic effects.

5. *Encoding Categorical Variables*:
   - Converting categorical variables into a numerical format that can be used by the model, such as one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding.
   - Handling high-cardinality categorical features using techniques like target encoding or label encoding.

6. *Time-series Specific Transformations*:
   - Applying differencing or detrending to make the time series stationary.
   - Creating time-based features like time of day, day of week, or month of year.
   - Handling temporal dependencies by creating lagged features or using time series-specific models.

The specific data transformations applied in this project would depend on the characteristics of the raw data, the insights gained from the signal analysis, and the requirements of the chosen modeling techniques. The goal of these transformations is to prepare the data in a way that can improve the model's ability to capture the underlying patterns and relationships, ultimately leading to better predictive performance.

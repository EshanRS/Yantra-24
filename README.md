# Yantra'24

This repository contains the code for Team 'Did it for the Cookiez' for the event 'Yantra'24' conducted by VIT, Vellore.

## Problem Statement

We present a forecasting challenge aimed at optimizing solar power production using machine learning models. Participants will develop predictive models to forecast key solar irradiance parameters, such as 'Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance', 'Direct Normal Irradiance', 'Global Horizontal Irradiance', and other parameters such as Dew Point, Relative, Humidity, Solar, Zenith Angle, Pressure, wind direction etc. based on a dataset spanning several years of environmental and meteorological data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, participants can create models to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of solar energy production, contributing to the global transition towards clean and renewable energy sources.

## Objective
​
We are here to innovate and create impactful solutions for a brighter, cleaner future powered by solar energy. ​
we have developd ML models to predict key parameters for optimizing solar power production and determine the best angle/tilt and facing for solar panels, leveraging historical environmental data, to enhance efficiency and contribute to clean energy transition.
